      <div class="about">
        I’m Ana, a freelance Communication Designer with a background in video
        production. I am currently completing my Masters in Graphic design. As a
        young freelancer based in London, I’m constantly surrounded by different
        cultures, faces and places everyday, allowing my creativity to flourish
        and enabling me to be productive in the art that I create. I find
        creativity and inspiration through visiting museums, talking to people
        from different backgrounds, and working on projects from my current
        Masters degree. It’s allowing me to improve my current skills in design,
        illustration, branding as well as develop new ones in fine-art and
        editorials. Professionally, I've done branding and identity for
        companies.
