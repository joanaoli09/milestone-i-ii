        <div class="about">
          I’m Ana, a freelance Communication Designer with a background in video
          production. I am currently completing my Masters in Graphic design. As
          a young freelancer based in London, I’m constantly surrounded by
          different cultures, faces and places everyday, allowing my creativity
          to flourish and enabling me to be productive in the art that I create.
          I find creativity and inspiration through visiting museums, talking to
          people from different backgrounds, and working on projects from my
          current Masters degree. It’s allowing me to improve my current skills
          in design, illustration, branding as well as develop new ones in
          fine-art and editorials. Professionally, I've done branding and
          identity for companies.
